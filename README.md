# Nextjs - Prisma - Tailwindcss - Twin.macro - Styled-components
This template based on **[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - [**Tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com/)** stack.

I create it for fans of [**Styled-components**](https://styled-components.com/), with purpose that incorporate [**Tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [**Styled-components**](https://styled-components.com/) by [**Twin.macro**](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro)!

> Twin blends the magic of Tailwind with the flexibility of css-in-js

In reallity, [**Twin.macro**](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) can make styled components just by itselfs. So if don't want to use [**Styled-components**](https://styled-components.com/), you can custom this template a little bit to use [**Twin.macro**](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro)'s styled components.
